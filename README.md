## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Pretty much my very first somewhat adequate C++ program. I am learning the C++ programming language for my University, and thought why not to give it a bit of practice and to write some programs. Expect more in the coming days as I learn more and progress.

## 💿 Working Principle <a name = "built_using"></a>

- Program asks user to input his height

- Program outputs the user's BMI rating and some text depending on the parameter
